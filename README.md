# miBuilds
First Django web application. Uses Django Framework, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and DataTables. The next iteration might be built using tools like NodeJS, AngularJS or Bootstrap.

The intent was to take an Excel model that calculates a cash flow, IRR, NPV, and payback month for a proposed capital outlay. These projects were geospatial in nature, with building and business identifiers that marked a build out location and had coordinates stored in a table. Additionally the business identifiers were utilized to tie to varying customer segments to make assumptions for revenenue and behavior. 

Please note that some key connection information has been removed.
